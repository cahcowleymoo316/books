# books

## Introduction
Goodreads doesn't quite tick all my boxes for analysing my reading behaviour. I've been tracking the books I'm reading since 2016 and will share some insights here.

## TODO:

1. Overview of the data, what is captured.
2. Moving the data into a new storage solution.
3. Summary of the books I've read (2016-2024) (the best, the worst, the shortest, the longest, the page-turners, the slow burns).
4. Trying to predict the time it will take me to read a new book.
